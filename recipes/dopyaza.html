            <li>200gms white onions finely chopped </li>
            <li> 1 ½tsp mild chilli powder (or kashmiri chilli powder)</li>
            <li> 200gms tomatoes pureed to a paste</li>
            <li>140gms greek yoghurt whisked   
             </li>
            <li>140gms new potatoes
            
             </li>
            <li>Salt to taste </li>
            <li>1 tbsp garam masala </li>
            <li>Coriander for garnish </li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Step 1:</b></li>
            <p>
                Grind the garlic and ginger in a blender with a splash of water. In a large mixing bowl add the chicken and mix in the garlic ginger paste. Mix well and set aside for an hour or overnight preferably
            </p>
            <li><b>Step 2:</b></li>
            <p>
                In a large heavy bottom sauce pan heat the oil over a medium flame. Add the bay leaves and chilli fry for a few seconds. Add the onion and fry for 17-18 minutes stir well and as they begin to brown add the marinated chicken. Turn the heat up slightly and seal the chicken pieces all over for 7-8 minutes.
            </p>
            <li><b>Step 3:</b></li>
            <p>
                Stir well and at this stage add chilli powder, turmeric, cumin and coriander powder. Fry for a minute. Add the pureed tomato and mix well scraping the bottom of the pan. Cook for 4 minutes.
            </p>
            <li><b>Step 4:</b></li>
            <p>
                Turn the heat back to medium and add the yoghurt a little at a time. Stir well making sure it doesn’t curdle for 6 minutes. Add water, new potatoes and season to taste. Turn the heat to a low setting and cook the chicken curry for 20 minutes with the lid on. Stir half way through the cooking process. Turn the heat off and add the garam masala. Leave the chicken to rest
            </p>
            <li><b>Step 5:</b></li>
            <p>
                In a frying pan heat the oil and fry the shallots for 5-6 minutes on each side over a medium heat. I like when the onions are slightly charred for you can fry them for a little longer if you wish. Add the fried shallots to the curry stir well. Add a splash of water if the gravy is too thick. Garnish with coriander and lemon juice. Serve with rice or roti.
