                    Chicken curry cooked with fried onions, tomato, spices and garam masala.<br>
                    ‘Do Pyaza’ meaning double onions is a term used for this north Indian curry. Slow cooking the onions
                    in a Murgh do Pyaza is key as its goes a lovely caramel colour and gives the curry a deep rich flavour to the resultant dish.

                <p style="margin-right: 12cm; ">
                    Creamy mushroom curry with cardamom, cashew nut and green peas.<br>
                    It’s not often that mushrooms are the main ingredient in Indian curries. 
                    With this malai (creamy) gravy, button mushrooms are the star ingredient working so well 
                    in a cashew based curry. 
                    The spice powder freshly ground and blended is akin to garam masala lending a warmth to the dish.
